          Nike, Inc., one of the world’s most recognized brands, is a
          multinational corporation known for its innovative sportswear,
          footwear, and athletic apparel. Founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports
          and officially renamed Nike, Inc. in 1971, the company is
          headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. The name "Nike" is inspired by the
          Greek goddess of victory, symbolizing the brand's commitment to
          empowering athletes and achieving excellence.
